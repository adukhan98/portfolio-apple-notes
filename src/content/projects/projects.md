# 🛠️ Applied Intelligence: Prototypes & Scale

A brief look at high-impact AI tools I've engineered and deployed.

## ai productivity hub (copilot best practices + prompt library)

- built an internal ai productivity hub with prompt templates, quick-start videos, and faqs
- created a structured feedback loop to capture real user needs
- scaled adoption from ~20 users to 150+ users in under 3 months

## ai voice notes → todos converter (claude code)

- built a tool that turns voice notes into clean, structured todos
- used claude code structured outputs to extract tasks, bugs, and timelines
- reduced manual documentation effort by ~30% for pilot teams

## ai product prototypes (vercel v0 + lovable + replit)

- rapidly built small ai tools including insight agents, summarizers, and ux prototypes
- used vercel v0 and lovable for fast frontend experimentation
- used replit for backend prototyping and multi-agent chaining

## football analytics and prediction ai agent (cursor + replit)

- used cursor to refactor and clean backend prediction workflows
- improved match prediction logic and data pipelines
- deployed on replit for easy web access and weekly predictions
