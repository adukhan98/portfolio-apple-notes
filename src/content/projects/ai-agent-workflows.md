# 🛠️ Applied Intelligence: Prototypes & Scale

A brief look at high-impact AI tools I've engineered and deployed.

## 1. Internal AI Productivity Hub (KPMG)

* **The Goal:** Operationalize best practices for Copilot and other LLMs within the firm.
* **Outcome:** Built an internal hub with 50+ prompt templates, FAQs, and structured feedback intake.
* **Impact:** Scaled adoption from ~20 users to 150+ within 3 months, creating a culture of consistent AI use.

## 2. AI Voice Notes → TODOs Converter

* **The Tool:** Uses **Claude Code's structured output** formatting to instantly extract tasks, bugs, and timelines from raw meeting audio/text.
* **Purpose:** Helps fast-moving engineering teams avoid missing follow-ups from hallway chats and support calls.
* **Impact:** Teams piloting the tool reported ~30% less time spent on manual writing and documentation.

## 3. AI Product Prototypes

* **Tech Stack:** Vercel v0, Lovable, Replit.
* **Activity:** Rapidly built micro-insight agents, summarizers, and UX prototypes, leveraging Replit for backend prototyping and chaining complex multi-agent flows.
* **Also:** Developed a Football Analytics and Prediction Agent hosted on Replit, featuring Cursor-assisted backend code cleanup.
