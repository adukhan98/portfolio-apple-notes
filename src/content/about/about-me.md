## about me

i build ai products so people can stop doing work they never wanted to do.

- i work at the intersection of product, data, and ai
- i translate vague ideas like “can ai just handle this?” into systems that actually ship
- i care less about demos and more about tools that survive real users

what i actually do day to day:

- turn messy problems into clear product roadmaps
- run user interviews and discover what hurts before writing a single prompt
- write prds, design workflows, and obsess over edge cases
- build and ship agentic systems, automations, and internal tools
- measure what ships, fix what breaks, and iterate until it’s boringly reliable

things i’ve learned the hard way:

- the model is rarely the hard part
- adoption beats sophistication every time
- “mostly right” is still wrong without guardrails
- trust, clarity, and usability matter more than clever prompts

how i think about work:

- chaos → structure → systems → leverage
- ideas are cheap, execution compounds
- if it doesn’t reduce time, friction, or cognitive load, it’s not done yet
- buzzwords collapse quickly when real users click real buttons

outside of work:

- i prototype small ai products for fun and learn by shipping
- i test new tools before they’re stable and break them to understand limits
- i create ai and productivity content online to make complex ideas simple and useful
- i enjoy explaining ai without making people feel stupid

non-negotiables and personality traits:

- low tolerance for hype
- high respect for clarity
- strong preference for things that scale
- mild obsession with clean workflows and good defaults

things i care about when i’m not thinking about ai:

- football, in all forms, all leagues, all arguments included
- formula 1, race weekends, strategy debates, and telemetry rabbit holes
- good systems, good design, and work that actually matters

if something can be automated, simplified, or made less annoying with ai, i probably want to build it.
