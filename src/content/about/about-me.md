# 📌 Adnaan Khan: The AI Product Builder

I am a **Senior AI & Data Consultant** and **Product Manager** focused on turning complex AI potential into tangible, measurable enterprise value. My core expertise lies in moving models from research to production, specializing in agentic workflows and developer productivity.

## currently building

* **Senior Consultant, AI & Data at KPMG Canada:** Driving the product strategy and roadmap for internal AI tooling that materially improves productivity for 200+ auditors and consultants. I lead hands-on deployment of multi-agent automations using tools like Microsoft Copilot and Claude Code.
* **AI Productivity:** Defining metrics, iterating on prompts, and building enterprise prompt libraries (50+ templates) to ensure AI consistency and reuse across deployed workflows.
* **AI Literacy & Content Creator:** Sharing engaging content on AI enablement and tech across platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram, reaching over 13 million impressions.

## the journey

* **Oracle:** Associate Consultant focused on product features for a B2B SaaS analytics platform, driving a 30% improvement in key performance metrics through targeted feature enhancements.
* **Concordia University:** Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
* **Vellore Institute of Technology:** Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

## connecting the dots

I believe the future of enterprise software is less about monolithic applications and more about **composable, safe, multi-agent workflows.** My goal is to orchestrate that transition.
