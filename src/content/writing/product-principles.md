# 💡 Core Tenets for AI Product

My philosophy is rooted in deliverable value, clarity, and compliance.

## Strategy & Roadmap

* **Focus on the Workflow, Not the Model:** Prioritize features that tangibly reduce manual work and improve decision accuracy, not just showcasing LLMs.
* **Measure Impact:** Define and monitor usage and quality metrics via SQL-based dashboards to drive iteration. If it can't be measured, it can't be prioritized.
* **Clarity is Throughput:** Tighter feedback loops and clearer prioritization drastically improve ticket resolution and SDLC clarity.

## Deployment & Safety

* **Enterprise Readiness First:** Embed privacy, traceability, and evaluation requirements directly into shipped workflows in partnership with security and legal teams.
* **Validate in the Wild:** Use a combination of human review, automated checks, and LLM-based scoring to validate output quality in production-like environments.
